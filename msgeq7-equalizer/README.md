# msgeq7-equalizer

This project uses the MSGEQ7 in order to power a 7 channel LED equalizer. You can find my full review of this chip <a href="https://blog.lmerza.com/?p=159">here</a>. The goal was to use current components that were already avilable. Using 70 LEDs, a 7x10 matrix was created by soldering the anodes in each row together and the cathodes in each column together.
